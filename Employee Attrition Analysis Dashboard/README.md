### Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard

### Project Overview
This project is an Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard developed in Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into employee attrition patterns within an organization, analyzing factors such as age, department, education level, job roles, and more. It enables HR and management teams to identify trends and make data-driven decisions to reduce turnover rates.

### Dashboard Features
- Total Employees: Displays the total number of employees.
- Attrition Count: Shows the total number of employees who left the organization.
- Attrition Rate: Calculates the attrition rate as a percentage of total employees.
- Average Age: Highlights the average age of the workforce.
- Average Salary: Displays the average salary of employees.
- Years of Retention: Shows the average retention period for employees.
   Key Visuals
- Attrition by Education: Pie chart displaying attrition distribution by education level.
- Attrition by Age: Bar chart showing attrition counts by different age groups.
- Attrition by Job Role: Table listing attrition count per job role, segmented by education level.
- Employee Count by Department: Pie chart showing the distribution of employees across departments.
- Attrition by Education Field: Bar chart visualizing attrition based on different fields of education.
### Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis includes anonymized employee data, with fields such as:

Age, Job Role, Department, Education Level, Education Field, Salary, Years of Experience, and more.
This dataset is designed to represent an organizationâ€™s employee data, allowing for meaningful analysis of attrition trends.

### Insights & Observations
- High Attrition in Age Group 26-35: Most of the attrition occurs within this age group, which may indicate higher turnover among younger employees.
- Education Level 3 has Highest Attrition: Employees with education level 3 exhibit the highest attrition rate.
- Sales Department with Higher Turnover: The Sales department has a significant portion of overall attrition.
   Role-Based Attrition: The Laboratory Technician role shows the highest attrition count, followed by Sales Executives and Research Scientists.
   These insights can help the HR team focus on specific areas to reduce attrition, such as increasing retention strategies for younger employees or those in high-turnover 
   roles.

### Technologies Used
- Power BI: For data visualization and creating the dashboard.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For calculations and measures.
- Data Preparation: Data cleaning and preparation for Power BI.
